To play this game, explore the Kingdom of Acadia and attack the mobs that are close to your level. As your experience increases you will level up, gaining attack power and defense. Animals will drop bones which can be traded in shops for new weapons and armor. Hunter classes focus on physical attacks and can become Heroes while Voodoo classes use magic and can level up to Mambos. If you earn enough experience you can even become a Swamp Master!
