To play this game, explore the Kingdom of Acadia and attack the mobs that are close to your level. As your experience increases you will level up, gaining attack power and defense. Animals will drop bones which can be traded in shops for new weapons and armor. Hunter classes focus on physical attacks and can become Heroes (Hunters get 2 attacks per turn, Heroes get 3 attacks per turn) while Voodoo classes use magic and can level up to Mambos (Voodoos and Mambos have twice the chance of scoring a hit and a 20% bonus to the amount of damage they do to mobs). If you earn enough experience you can even become a Swamp Master!
