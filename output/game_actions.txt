If you see an NPC (non-playable character - a vendor, quest-giver, or other character that you cannot attack) you can interact with them by typing their first name, for example to talk to 'Amos the Blacksmith' type 'Amos' or 'amos'. This will open up a new options window. If you see any MOBs (mobiles - a character or animal that you can attack), there will be a 'counter' number assigned to that mob. To either inspect or attack that mob, type the mob's counter number e.g. '1'.
